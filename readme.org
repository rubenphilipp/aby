* About

Aby[fn:1] is a simple fragment/snippet manager for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It lets you easily
insert the contents of files from a designated snippets directory in an Emacs
buffer by using the command ~aby-insert~. 

** Example

~M-x aby-insert lisp/robodoc-class~

will search for a file =robodoc-class.el= in the =lisp= sub-directory of the
current buffer. This file contains further instructions on how to parse
the source file of the template. The latter is located in the same directory
as the /instruction file/ and can be a file with any extension.[fn:2]

The code from the /instruction file/ must return a string which will then
be inserted into the current buffer.

[fn:2] This enables proper syntax highlighting and indentation, which is
especially valuable when working with code files.
