Aby[fn:1] is a simple fragment/snippet manager for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It lets you easily
insert the contents of files from a designated snippets directory into an Emacs
buffer by using the command ~aby-insert~.

Furthermore, Aby is capable of dynamically altering certain elements in a
fragment file by using custom defined functions (cf. the documentation for
=aby/aby-instruct= for more information on building instruction lists).

** Example

~M-x aby-insert lisp/robodoc-class~

will search for a file in the ~aby-fragments-dir~, matching the
~aby-file-extension~ (default =aby.el=). It will evaluate the /Elisp/
expressions in this file in a /temp-buffer/, expecting an association list
with replacements rules as the return value. Again, the documentation of
=aby/aby-instruct= shed some light on the data structure.

The resulting /replacements rules/ will the be parsed by the ~aby-insert~
function, which performs variable allocations and regex-replacements, and
eventually inserts the resulting string into the current buffer.

* Installation

Place the files of this program on your hard-drive and load the files to
your /Emacs/ configuration, e.g. via:

#+begin_src elisp
  (load "~/.emacs.d/aby/src/aby.el")

  (require 'aby)
#+end_src

These expressions could be placed in your ~.emacs~ file.

** Configuration

In order to alter the Aby configuration, you can modify the config variables
(cf. the variables documentation in the =doc=) after load. An example
config-file can be found on ~/examples/aby-config.el~.

* Usage

As exemplified in the previous example, an /Aby/ snippet is inserted via the
~aby-insert~ command.
The ~examples~ directory contains a (somewhat "recursive") file for creating
/Aby/ ~instruction-files~ (cf. ~examples/fragments/aby/aby-instruct.aby.el~).
This one comes in very handy when creating new /aby-instruct/ files (cf. doc). 

* Help

The ~/examples~ directory contains examples both for configuration and the
creation of Aby fragments (i.e. instruction and snippet files).
Detailed insight on how to construct instruction files and information on the
parsing/insertion process can be gained by reading the =/doc= (dive in via
~/doc/index.html~) and especially examining the functions ~aby/aby-instruct~
and ~aby/aby-insert~.
